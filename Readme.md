Statically typed programming languages perform type checking at compile time. For some languages, this means that the type of variable is specified by the programmer eg Java, C, C++ while
Dynamically typed programming languages perform type checking at run-time ie it is associated with run-time values and not named variables. This means that the programmer can write faster and not need to specify variable types eg Python, PHP, Javascript

Null is a special value which represents an empty or unknown value eg let number = null
